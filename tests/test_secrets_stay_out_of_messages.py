"""
THE KEY MUST NOT APPEAR IN AN ERROR MESSAGE.

``links.py`` says a log line carrying the fragment quietly undoes the product. An
exception message IS a log line: applications log what they did not catch, and
error trackers keep it for months. So the rule is not "do not log the key" — the
library cannot control what a caller logs — it is that the library never hands a
caller a message with the key in it.

THE CASES THAT MATTER ARE THE NEAR MISSES. A key that is obviously wrong is
usually not a key at all. A key that is one pasted character short, or has a
smart quote where a hyphen should be, or arrived in a link whose path we do not
recognise, IS the real key, and that is exactly when something raises.

This file feeds a real key through every failure it can reach and asserts the key
does not come back out. It found two leaks when it was written: one in
crypto.key_text, and one in parse_link that predates it.
